# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
Creating a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib skills. 

### Purpose
Creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The line graph can then be used to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.  


## Results
1. Description of the differences:

      
      Image 1 - PyBer Summary
      
         Urban city has the greatest number of drivers and rides but collects the highest fare totol at $39,854.  
         Fare per driver is the lowest of the three. 
         
         Suburban city falls inbetween rural and urban city, with the total fare being $19,356. 
         
         Rural total fare is $4,327 but has the highest fare per ride at $34.  There are only 78 drivers.  
      
      
      Image 2 - Weekly fares between January 2019 and April 2019 show:
   
         Urban fares increased in March
   
         Suburban fares also increased during the month of March
   
         Rural fares in increased during March and April but fares remained at a lower cost. 


2. Total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary
Three business recommendations regarding disparities among the city types.

1. The average fare for urban drivers is significantly lower than rural and suburban drivers. 
2. A rural customer has to pay the highest fare as it appears to be more competitive in the rural city. 
3. Perhaps there should be more urban drivers in order to lower the distances and fares.
