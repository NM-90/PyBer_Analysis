# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
Creating a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib skills. 

### Purpose
Creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The line graph can then be used to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.  

 
## Results
1. Description of the differences:

2. Total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary
Three business recommendations regarding disparities among the city types.

1. The average fare for urban drivers is significantly lower than the other two city types. 
2. A rural customer has to pay the highest fare as it appears to be more competitive in the rural city. 
3.
